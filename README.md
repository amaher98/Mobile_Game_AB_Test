## Mobile Game A/B Test:

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. In this project, I am working to understand the results of an A/B test run for the popular mobile game "Cookie Cats". As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, I will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, I will analyze the impact on player retention.
